## Game Logic
* The player starts with 3 lives and 0 score
* Game win logic: the player crosses all the bugs untouched and reaches water. That adds 100 points to the player score
* Game lose logic: when the player is hit by one of the bugs. That deduct one life from him. If the player has more lives, he is reset to his start positions. If the player has no more lives -lives = 0- game ends and the player is shown his final score.
